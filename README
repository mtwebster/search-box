This is a Cinnamon applet, which adds a Web Search box to your Cinnamon bar.

Left-clicking the item will open a search box where you can enter your criteria.
You can right-click the applet to edit the search provider file, changing the provider, or adding your own (and its label)

Installation
================
	
	1) Unzip, copy the folder "search-box@mtwebster" to "~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/".
	
	2) Enable the applet in cinnamon settings.

If you change providers, you'll have to restart Cinnamon
